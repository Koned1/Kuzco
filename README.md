# Kuzco
### 1. **Prepare Your Environment**
   - **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure your machine meets the necessary hardware specifications, such as having a compatible GPU. Specific hardware requirements are usually detailed on the Kuzco documentation site.
   - **Operating System**: Kuzco supports macOS, Windows, and Linux. Choose your operating system and follow the respective installation steps.

### 2. **Install Kuzco CLI**
   - **macOS/Linux**: Open a terminal and run the following command to install the Kuzco CLI:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://kuzco.xyz/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - **Windows**: If you're using Windows, you can either use the Kuzco Desktop App or run Kuzco on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For WSL, follow the instructions provided in the [WSL Setup Guide](https://docs.kuzco.xyz/wsl-setup).

### 3. **Register and Initialize Your Node**
   - After installation, you need to register an account with Kuzco. Use the CLI to register:
     ```bash
     kuzco register
     ```
   - After registration, initialize your Kuzco worker:
     ```bash
     kuzco init
     ```
   - This command will guide you through the configuration of your node.

### 4. **Configure Your Validator**
   - During initialization, you will be prompted to configure your node as a validator. Follow the on-screen instructions carefully to ensure your node is set up correctly.

### 5. **Start the Node**
   - Once configured, start your node using the following command:
     ```bash
     kuzco start
     ```
   - The node will now connect to the Kuzco network and begin participating in the validation process.

### 6. **Monitor and Maintain**
   - Regularly monitor your node to ensure it is running correctly and efficiently. Kuzco provides tools and documentation for maintaining your node, including logs and performance metrics.
